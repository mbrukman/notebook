# Collections

The only type of collection available right now is a sortable/filterable list of
documents, with filetype-specific icons in the [`docs-list`](docs-list/#readme)
directory.

In this directory, you'll also find [`md-icons.html`](md-icons.html) which you
can open in a browser to preview some of the Material Icons; a subset of them
are used in the docs list above.
