## Overview

This digital notebook is for keeping track of semi-structured data, such as
lists and collections of URLs, for sharing and reference.

This is a work-in-progress; here are some ongoing efforts:

* Preact-based [web UI](web/ui/#readme) and [Go API server](web/server)

  You can run the web UI [directly](web/ui/#readme), or you can use the
  provided [Dockerfile](docker) to build and run the container locally.

* [collections UI](prototypes/collections/#readme) prototype
